Deployed using GitHub Pages.

## Description

Built with React, Semantic UI, Material UI, and Moment.js. This project finds the current and forecasted weather based on your location using the OpenWeatherMaps API. After the user enables their location in the browser the app will get their lattitue and logitude coordinates and fetch 2 APIs from OpenWeatherMaps, the current weaather data and forecast weather data for the next five days. The component weather.js will display the location, time, date, temperature with a corresponding weather icon, humidity, sunrise and sunset times on a card on the top of the page. The forecast.js component uses the .map method on forecastData to display the forecasted temperature highs and lows for the next five days.
